# Notes for Thesis Work
These notes act as progress report (research diary) throughout the thesis work. The note taking starts when the accompanying course starts (Begleitseminar), and ends when the thesis has been completed successfully. The notes should be visible for the course lectureres and the supervisor of the thesis.

## 03.03.2024
- Setup this repository and setup the diary.
- Setup latex already, I am planning to write stuff on the side already (so I wont forget about it, also I will try to finish the writing about a topic with every milestone as well eG once the room-setup is done I want to write the according chapter(s) for it as well). We'll see how well it works ^^'
- Planned a timeline in preparation for the kickoff with markus on tuesday.

<!--
The notes have the following minimal requirements:
- must be continously updated (at least once a week, even though there is nothing to report)
- must contain notes of discussions in the course units that accompany the thesis (Begleitseminare) 
- must contain the notes of meetings with supervisors 
- must be uploaded to the gitlab repository of the thesis
- are written in a single file starting with the newest date
- are written in markdown language

Complete notes are required to pass the accompanying courses for thesis work in Bachelor and Master. If the requirements stated above are not fulfilled, the course fails. If no notes have been taken, a compensation work will be defined that includes a written report representing the time frame of the thesis work, but can also include additional work.
